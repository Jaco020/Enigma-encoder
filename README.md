# Enigma-encoder
Encrypt and decrypt messages online with Enigma cipher.  
Enigma encryption is symmetric, which means that the same settings can be used to both encrypt or decrypt a message
# Enigma machine
The Enigma machines are a series of electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines. The first machines were invented at the end of World War I by German engineer Arthur Scherbius and were mainly used to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication. Enigma machines became more and more complex and were heavily used by the German army during World War II to encrypt radio signals.
